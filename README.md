# Teacher Portal Application

## Overview

I have successfully developed a robust teacher portal using Ruby on Rails (ROR). The portal includes the following features:

**Login Screen:** A secure authentication system allowing teachers to log in and access the portal.

**Home Screen:** The main dashboard for teachers, which features a comprehensive student listing. This screen allows teachers to view and manage student records.

**Student Management:** Functionality to efficiently handle student information. Teachers can add new students and update or manage existing student records through an intuitive interface.

This portal provides a streamlined and effective solution for teachers to manage their students and access essential tools within a single platform.
